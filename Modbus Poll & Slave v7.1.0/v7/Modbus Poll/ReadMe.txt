Getting started:
-----------------------------
1. Press F3 to setup a connection.
2. Press F8 to setup protocol definition.
   Example:
   You want to read 20 holding registers from address 40011 (10).
   - Slave ID  = The ID of your device
   - Function  = 03 Read Holding Registers
   - Address   = 10 (Protocol address)
   - Quantity  = 20
   - Scan Rate = 1000 (Then it will poll for data every 1000ms)

3. To change a value just start typing or double click the cell.


Note: You can always press F1 for help.



Warning:
-----------------------------
The use of RTS controlled RS232/RS485 converters should be avoided if possible.
It is difficult to determine the exact time when to switch off the transmitter
with non real-time operating systems like Windows and Linux. If it is switched
off to early characters might still sit in the FIFO or the transmit register of
the UART and these characters will be lost. Hence the slave will not recognize
the message. On the other hand if it is switched off too late then the slave's
message is corrupted and the master will not recognize the message.
