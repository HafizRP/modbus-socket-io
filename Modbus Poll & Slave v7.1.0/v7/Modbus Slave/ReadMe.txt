Modbus Slave overview:
-----------------------------
Modbus Slave is a powerful, easy to use, slave simulating
tool. Modbus Slave will run on all 32/64-bit Windows versions
in use today - XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.

You can open up to 32 windows each containing a slave/data
area. A window can simmulate up to 4096 coils or 2048
registers.
OLE Automation for interfacing with Visual Basic
Excel etc. See included example how to edit data with Excel.




Note:
In Windows it is not possible to measure the 3.5 character
idle time between two Modbus frames. That means that it may not
be possible to use Modbus Slave in parallel with another
slave device unless you are sure that the delay in the slave
is > 20ms.
